# A psychoacoustic sonification design for monitoring preterm infants via pulse oximetry

I did this project as part of my master thesis. The Pure Data patches developed for the sound design of the Pulse Oximeter are in this repository. The sounddesign is described in detail in the "Sounddesign" file. 
In the present study pink noise was generated by an object from the Cyclone library, which is based on Max/MSP (Puckette & Zicarelli, 2020).
